# DATA 598 Capstone

Overview:
The capstone will assess your ability to prepare a technical report as well as
produce calibrated predicted sample paths for stock closing prices.
You will be given 21 different time series to analyze/forecast. The goal
is not for you to demonstrate expertise in understanding financial time series,
but rather, leverage what you have learned in this course as well as
conduct your own literature review to decide on the right methodology.
You are free to pursue any methodology as long as you can explain how to
implement it in a production setting for generating sample paths.
